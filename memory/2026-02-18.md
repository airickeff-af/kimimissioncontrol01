# Memory Log - 2026-02-18

## Early Morning System Check (1:37 AM)

### Improvement Cycle Analysis

**System Status:**
- Main session tokens: 151,766/262,144 (58% - healthy)
- Disk usage: 8.8G/40G (24% - healthy)
- Cron jobs: 17 active, all healthy (0 consecutive errors)
- Agents: 16 active sessions, 1 aborted in last 24h

**Friction Points Identified:**

1. **CRON JOB OVERLAP** - Multiple improvement cycles running concurrently
   - `nexus-improvement-cycle` (every 2 hours) - CURRENT RUN
   - `nexus-self-improvement` (every 1.5 hours)
   - `self-improvement-continuous` (every 30 min)
   - `nexus-innovation-sprint` (every 2 hours)
   - **Impact:** Redundant work, wasted tokens
   - **Fix:** Consolidate into single improvement cycle

2. **PENDING TASKS OUT OF SYNC** - PENDING_TASKS.md shows 37 tasks but TASK_QUEUE.md shows empty
   - **Impact:** Confusion about actual workload
   - **Fix:** Sync systems, standardize on one source of truth

3. **ABORTED SESSION RECOVERY** - 1 aborted session (forge-coder) not recovered
   - **Impact:** Potential lost work
   - **Fix:** Apply abort recovery protocol

4. **MEMORY BANK FRAGMENTATION** - Multiple memory files (MEMORY.md, MEMORY_BANK.md, daily logs)
   - **Impact:** Hard to find information
   - **Fix:** Consolidate into clear hierarchy

**Quick Wins Implemented:**

1. **Created today's memory log** (this file)
2. **Identified cron consolidation opportunity** - will propose to EricF
3. **Verified system health** - all metrics green

**Recommendations for EricF:**

1. **Approve cron consolidation** - Merge 4 improvement cycles into 1 (saves ~50% tokens)
2. **Choose single task system** - Either PENDING_TASKS.md or TASK_QUEUE.md
3. **Review blocked tasks** - 25 tasks blocked, many waiting for EricF input
