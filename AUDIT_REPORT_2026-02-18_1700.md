## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE DETECTED

While no tasks were completed in the audit window, a **CRITICAL QUALITY GATE FAILURE** was detected:

### **TASK-070: P0 - Fix Complete Deployment Failure**
- **Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
- **Quality Gate Score:** 0/100 (Required: 95/100)
- **Report:** `/root/.openclaw/workspace/QUALITY_GATE_REPORT_2026-02-18.md`
- **Created:** 4:49 PM (11 minutes ago)

**Problem:**
All pages and API endpoints return 404. Site completely inaccessible.
- Root URL: 404
- All HTML pages: 404
- All API endpoints: 404
- Deployment is non-functional

**Root Causes:**
1. Root workspace lacks `index.html` (main entry point)
2. Main dashboard files are in `mission-control/dashboard/` but deployment uses root
3. `vercel.json` missing static file routes
4. API endpoints not properly exposed

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### For EricF:
1. **URGENT:** TASK-070 (Deployment Failure) requires immediate attention
2. **Process Gap:** No tasks completed in last 30 minutes - verify agent activity
3. **Quality Gate:** Current deployment score (0/100) is unacceptable

### For Code Team:
1. Prioritize TASK-070 over all other work
2. Implement pre-deploy verification checklist
3. Add index.html existence check to deployment pipeline
