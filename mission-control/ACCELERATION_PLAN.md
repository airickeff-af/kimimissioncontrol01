**Nexus (Air1ck3ff) - Orchestrator**  
**Time:** 7:08 PM | **Deadline:** Feb 18 NOON (17 hours)

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

| Task | Agent | Status | Completed | Blocker |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Dashboard Integration** | Forge | 🟡 Working | ~60% | Tab system not implemented |
| **DealFlow Database** | DealFlow | ✅ **DONE** | 100% | None |
| **Backend API** | Code | ✅ **DONE** | 100% | None |

---

## ⚡ WHAT I'M DOING TO SPEED UP

### 1. **PARALLEL EXECUTION** (Already Active)
- ✅ Spawned 4 agents simultaneously
- ✅ DealFlow + Code completed in parallel
- ⏳ Forge still working on dashboard

### 2. **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** (Next 30 min)

**A. Accelerate Forge (Critical Path)**
```
Action: Spawn Forge-2 to help with UI polish
Task: Complete tab navigation system
ETA: 30 minutes
```

**B. Start Reviews Early**
```
Action: Have Audit review DealFlow + Code NOW
While Forge is still working
ETA: 20 minutes
```

**C. Prepare Deployment Pipeline**
```
Action: Test deployment script
Verify all components integrate
ETA: 15 minutes
```

### 3. **CONTINGENCY PLAN** (If Forge delays)

**Option A: Deploy Without Full Integration**
- Use existing `index-integrated.html` as main
- Link to separate tab files
- Deploy by 10 PM

**Option B: Manual Override**
- I (Nexus) complete the dashboard integration
- Use existing components
- Deploy by 11 PM

## 👤 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### IMMEDIATE (Next 10 minutes):

1. **Review DealFlow Output**
   - Check `/mission-control/agents/dealflow/leads.json`
   - Verify 6 leads look correct
   - Approve or request changes

2. **Review Code Output**
   - Check `/mission-control/backend/test_api.sh` results
   - Verify API meets your needs
   - Approve or request changes

3. **Decide on Dashboard Priority**
   - Option A: Deploy working version tonight, polish tomorrow
   - Option B: Wait for full integration (risk missing deadline)

### TONIGHT (Before 10 PM):

4. **Create Telegram Groups** (if you want them)
   - Use @BotFather to create bot
   - Create groups per TELEGRAM_GROUPS.md
   - Send me group IDs

5. **Approve Memory Optimization**
   - Review MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md
   - Say "implement it" and I'll set it up

### TOMORROW:

6. **Final Approval**
   - Review deployed dashboard
   - Test all features
   - Sign off or request fixes
