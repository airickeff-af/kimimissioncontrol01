## Person 1: NFT Space

### Chris Maddern
**Role:** Chief Technology Officer (CTO)  
**Company:** OpenSea

---

### Why He's Influential

Chris Maddern joined OpenSea in 2023 through the acquisition of his company Rally, where he served as co-founder and CEO. Since becoming CTO, he has been the driving force behind OpenSea's critical pivot from a pure NFT marketplace to a comprehensive "onchain everything" platform.

**Key Achievements (2024-2025):**

1. **Led OpenSea's Mobile-First Transformation**: Maddern's acquisition brought deep mobile expertise to OpenSea, resulting in a completely redesigned mobile app launched in 2025. Under his technical leadership, OpenSea regained market leadership from Blur after three years, widening the gap materially throughout 2025.

2. **Architect of OpenSea's Token Trading Integration**: Maddern has been instrumental in expanding OpenSea beyond NFTs to support fungible token trading, positioning the platform as a comprehensive crypto trading hub. He publicly stated the vision is to consolidate "the best of NFTs, tokens, DeFi and other onchain assets" into a single platform.

3. **Technical Infrastructure Overhaul**: Under his leadership, OpenSea has focused on rebuilding its technical infrastructure to support the "onchain everything" vision, including wallet technology improvements and cross-chain capabilities.

4. **Patent Portfolio**: Maddern holds multiple patents, including "Organizing Images Based on Metadata Similarities" (US Patent, December 2012) and "Contextual eCommerce Shopping Cart Adjustment" (US Patent Application, 2014), demonstrating his long history of technical innovation in digital commerce.

### Why He's "Overlooked"

Despite being CTO of the largest NFT marketplace, Chris Maddern operates largely outside the crypto spotlight:

1. **Not a Public Figure**: While OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer receives media attention and speaks at major conferences, Maddern focuses on execution rather than public relations.

2. **Recent Joiner**: Having joined through acquisition in 2023, he lacks the "founder mystique" of early OpenSea team members, despite now leading all technical decisions.

3. **Builder Mentality**: His background as an engineer and product builder means he prefers shipping code to Twitter threads. His social media presence is modest (~48K followers) compared to other crypto CTOs.

4. **Behind-the-Scenes Impact**: The market share recovery and mobile app success are attributed to "OpenSea" rather than Maddern personally, even though these were his direct initiatives.

## Person 2: DeFi/RWA Space

### Serena Leung
**Role:** Head of RWA Tokenization  
**Company:** Polygon Labs

---

### Why She's Influential

Serena Leung leads Polygon Labs' Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization strategy, making her one of the most important technical-business hybrid leaders in the institutional adoption of blockchain technology. Polygon has emerged as the leading blockchain for tokenized assets with over $1.13 billion in TVL as of late 2025.

**Key Achievements (2024-2025):**

1. **Led Polygon to #1 in RWA Rankings**: Under her leadership, Polygon became the top blockchain for tokenized real-world assets, surpassing Ethereum and other competitors. The network now hosts over $1.1 billion in tokenized assets including bonds, funds, and credit products.

2. **Institutional Tokenization Pipeline**: Leung has been instrumental in bringing major traditional finance institutions to tokenize on Polygon, including partnerships with financial giants for bond tokenization and fund management.

3. **Cross-Chain RWA Strategy**: She has led Polygon's approach to making RWAs interoperable across chains, addressing one of the biggest technical challenges in institutional tokenization.

4. **Thought Leadership**: Regular speaker at major industry events including SmartCon 2025 (Chainlink's flagship conference) and RWA Summit, where she presents on bridging traditional finance and Web3.

5. **Stablecoin Ecosystem Growth**: Part of the leadership team that drove Polygon's stablecoin market cap growth, which reached significant milestones in 2024-2025.

### Why She's "Overlooked"

Despite leading the most successful RWA tokenization platform, Serena Leung remains relatively unknown outside institutional circles:

1. **Institutional vs. Retail Focus**: Polygon's RWA strategy targets institutional clients (banks, asset managers) rather than retail crypto users, so her work receives less social media attention than consumer-facing protocols.

2. **New Role**: She joined Polygon Labs in 2024, making her relatively new to the position despite rapid success.

3. **TradFi Background**: Unlike crypto-native founders who build audiences through years of Twitter engagement, Leung came from Standard Chartered with a traditional finance network rather than a crypto following.

4. **Polygon's Decentralized Narrative**: Polygon Labs emphasizes the ecosystem over individual leaders. While founder Sandeep Nailwal receives media attention, operational leaders like Leung are rarely featured in press coverage.

5. **Technical-Business Hybrid**: Her role bridges complex technical implementation with institutional business development—a crucial but less "sexy" narrative than DeFi yield farming or memecoins.
