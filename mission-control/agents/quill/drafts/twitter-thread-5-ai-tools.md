# Twitter Thread: 5 AI Tools That Actually Save Time

## Tweet 1/7 (Hook)
I tested 47 AI tools this month.

Most were hype.
But 5 genuinely saved me 10+ hours/week.

Here they are (the last one surprised me):

## Tweet 2/7 (Tool 1: Claude/ChatGPT)
1. CLAUDE (or ChatGPT) — but used RIGHT

Don't just chat. Build systems:
• Draft emails in your voice
• Summarize 50-page reports in 2 min
• Code review before you commit

Saves: 3-4 hrs/week

## Tweet 3/7 (Tool 2: Otter.ai/Descript)
2. OTTER.AI for meetings

• Auto-transcribes every call
• Searchable archive
• Pulls action items automatically

No more "wait, what did they say?"

Saves: 2-3 hrs/week

## Tweet 4/7 (Tool 3: Midjourney/Canva AI)
3. MIDJOURNEY for visuals

Blog headers, social graphics, thumbnails—all in minutes.

Used to take me 2 hours in Photoshop.
Now? 15 minutes.

Saves: 2-3 hrs/week

## Tweet 5/7 (Tool 4: Notion AI)
4. NOTION AI for writing

• First drafts from bullet points
• Summarize long docs
• Fix grammar without leaving the page

My second brain just got faster.

Saves: 1-2 hrs/week

## Tweet 6/7 (Tool 5: The Surprise)
5. GITHUB COPILOT — even if you're not a "developer"

• Write scripts to automate tasks
• Build simple tools
• Fix broken code you copy from Stack Overflow

This one surprised me most.

Saves: 2-4 hrs/week

## Tweet 7/7 (CTA)
Total time saved: 10-16 hours/week

That's 500+ hours/year.

What could you build with an extra 500 hours?
