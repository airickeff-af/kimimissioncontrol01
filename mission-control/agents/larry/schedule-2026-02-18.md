## POST 1: 9:00 AM - Twitter/X

### Content: AI Tools Thread (Part 1)

**Tweet 1/7 (Hook):**
```
I tested 47 AI tools this month.

Most were hype.
But 5 genuinely saved me 10+ hours/week.

Here they are (the last one surprised me):

🧵
```

**Tweet 2/7:**
```
1. CLAUDE (or ChatGPT) — but used RIGHT

Don't just chat. Build systems:
• Draft emails in your voice
• Summarize 50-page reports in 2 min
• Code review before you commit

Saves: 3-4 hrs/week
```

**Tweet 3/7:**
```
2. OTTER.AI for meetings

• Auto-transcribes every call
• Searchable archive
• Pulls action items automatically

No more "wait, what did they say?"

Saves: 2-3 hrs/week
```

**Hashtags:** #AI #Productivity #Automation  
**Action:** Pin first tweet  
**Engagement Monitor:** Watch for replies, plan responses

## POST 2: 2:00 PM - LinkedIn

### Content: AI Productivity Professional Post

**Format:** Single post with professional tone

```
I tested 47 AI tools this month so you don't have to.

Most were marketing hype.
But 5 tools genuinely saved me 10+ hours every week.

Here are the standouts that actually moved the needle:

→ CLAUDE/ChatGPT — Not for chatting. For building systems.
  • Draft emails in your voice
  • Summarize 50-page reports in 2 minutes
  • Code review before you commit
  Time saved: 3-4 hrs/week

→ OTTER.AI — Meeting intelligence
  • Auto-transcribes every call
  • Searchable archive
  • Pulls action items automatically
  Time saved: 2-3 hrs/week

→ MIDJOURNEY — Visual creation at scale
  • Blog headers, social graphics, thumbnails
  • What took 2 hours in Photoshop → 15 minutes
  Time saved: 2-3 hrs/week

→ NOTION AI — Writing acceleration
  • First drafts from bullet points
  • Summarize long docs
  • Fix grammar without leaving the page
  Time saved: 1-2 hrs/week

→ GITHUB COPILOT — Even for non-developers
  • Write scripts to automate tasks
  • Build simple tools
  • Fix broken code from Stack Overflow
  Time saved: 2-4 hrs/week

Total: 10-16 hours/week = 500+ hours/year

What could you accomplish with an extra 500 hours?
