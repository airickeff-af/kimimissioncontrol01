### Touch 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)
**Subject:** Quick question about {{company}}'s crypto strategy

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company}} recently {{recent_news}}. Congratulations on the progress.

I'm reaching out from Eric Fung's team - we're working with several {{industry}} companies on partnership opportunities in the APAC crypto market.

Given {{company}}'s focus on {{focus_area}}, I thought there might be synergy with what we're building.

Worth a brief conversation?

Best,  
{{sender_name}}

### Touch 2: Value Add (Day 3)
**Subject:** {{first_name}}, thought this might interest you

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on my note about potential partnership opportunities.

I came across this report on {{relevant_topic}} and immediately thought of {{company}}: {{insight}}

Worth a 15-minute call to explore if there's a fit?

Best,  
{{sender_name}}

### Touch 3: Social Proof (Day 7)
**Subject:** How {{similar_company}} expanded in APAC

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick note - we recently helped {{similar_company}} establish partnerships with 3 major exchanges in Singapore and Hong Kong, resulting in {{result}}.

Given {{company}}'s {{strength}}, I see similar potential.

Open to a brief conversation this week?

### Touch 4: Soft Breakup (Day 14)
**Subject:** Should I close your file, {{first_name}}?

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about potential partnership opportunities between {{company}} and our network.

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume timing isn't right and close your file.

If priorities change, feel free to reach out.

Best,  
{{sender_name}}

### Touch 5: Final Attempt (Day 21)
**Subject:** Last try: {{company}} + APAC expansion

{{first_name}},

One final note - we're finalizing our Q1 partnership pipeline and wanted to give {{company}} one last opportunity to explore APAC market entry.

If there's interest, reply and I'll send over a brief overview. If not, no worries.

Best,  
{{sender_name}}
