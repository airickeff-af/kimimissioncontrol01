## 📋 WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

After creating the repo, give me:

### Option A: GitHub Token (Easiest for me)
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `workflow` (if using GitHub Actions)
4. Generate token
5. **Copy and send me the token**

I'll push all files and connect Vercel automatically.

### Option B: Add me as Collaborator
1. Go to your repo → Settings → Manage access
2. Click "Invite a collaborator"
3. Add my GitHub username: (I'll give you one, or use token)

---

### Option C: You Push Files (Manual)
I'll create a ZIP file with all files, you:
1. Download ZIP
2. Extract to your repo folder
3. Push to GitHub
4. Connect Vercel yourself

## 🔄 AFTER GITHUB SETUP

### Auto-Deploy Magic:

You change files → Push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys
```

**No more manual redeploys!**

## ✅ RECOMMENDED: Option A (Token)

**Why:**

- Future updates: I push, you approve

**Time:** 5 minutes total
