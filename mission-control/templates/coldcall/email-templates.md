## 1. Initial Cold Outreach

### Template

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: `Partnership opportunity: Philippines' $107B crypto market`
- B: `{{companyName}} + coins.ph in SEA?`
- C: `Quick question about {{companyName}}'s Asia expansion`

---

Hi {{firstName}},

I saw {{companyName}}'s recent {{recentNews}} and wanted to reach out about a strategic opportunity in Southeast Asia.

**The context:** coins.ph is the Philippines' largest licensed crypto exchange with **18.6 million users** and **75-80% market share** in peso-to-stablecoin liquidity. The Philippines ranks **#9 globally** in crypto adoption with a **$38.4 billion** annual remittance market.

**Why this matters for {{companyName}}:**
{{specificValueProp}}

We're BSP-licensed (VASP, EMI, FX) with recent partnerships including Circle and Veem that have shown strong traction in bridging TradFi with crypto rails.

Worth a brief conversation to explore synergies?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title] | coins.ph & coins.xyz

P.S. — We're also expanding globally through coins.xyz with hubs in Brazil, Nigeria, EU, and SEA.

---

### When to Use
- First contact with a qualified prospect
- After researching their recent news/expansion
- When you have a clear value proposition

### Customization Tips
- Replace `{{recentNews}}` with something specific from the last 30-60 days
- Make `{{specificValueProp}}` about THEM, not you (1-2 sentences max)
- Keep the entire email under 150 words

---

## 2. Follow-up #1 (No Response)

### Template

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: `Re: Partnership opportunity: Philippines' $107B crypto market`
- B: `Bumping this up, {{firstName}}`
- C: `Quick follow: {{companyName}} + coins.ph`

---

Hi {{firstName}},

Wanted to make sure this didn't get buried — I know inboxes are brutal.

Quick recap: I'm exploring how {{companyName}} might benefit from partnering with coins.ph (Philippines' largest licensed exchange, 18.6M users, BSP-regulated).

**Specifically thinking about:**
{{specificValueProp}}

If the timing's not right, no worries — just say the word and I'll circle back in a few months.

If it is, I'm happy to:
- Send a one-pager first
- Jump on a 15-minute call
- Connect you directly with our {{technical/commercial}} team

What works best?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

### When to Use
- 3-4 business days after initial email with no response
- When you believe the prospect is a strong fit

### Customization Tips
- Reference the original subject line for continuity
- Make the "Specifically thinking about" section even more targeted
- Offering multiple options increases response rate

---

## 3. Follow-up #2 (Still No Response)

### Template

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: `Last try: {{companyName}} + Philippines market access`
- B: `Should I close the loop on this?`
- C: `One more shot — then I'll leave you alone`

---

Hi {{firstName}},

I don't want to be that person who keeps emailing when you're not interested — so this is my last outreach unless you tell me otherwise.

**Here's why I thought this was worth your time:**
{{companyName}} is {{doing X}} and coins.ph has {{18.6M users in the #9 crypto adoption market globally}}. The overlap seemed obvious.

But maybe:
- Timing's off
- You're focused elsewhere
- I got the value prop wrong

If any of the above, just hit reply with "not now" and I'll disappear (gracefully).

If there's still interest, I'm here.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — If someone else at {{companyName}} handles partnerships, happy to redirect. Just let me know.

---

### When to Use
- 5-7 days after Follow-up #1 with no response
- When you want to create urgency without being pushy

### Customization Tips
- The "Here's why I thought..." section should be your strongest value prop
- The "But maybe..." section shows empathy and reduces friction
- The P.S. can uncover if you're talking to the wrong person

---

## 4. Value-Add Follow-up (Share Insight/News)

### Template

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: `Thought this might interest you, {{firstName}}`
- B: `{{recentIndustryNews}} — implications for {{companyName}}`
- C: `Saw this and thought of our conversation`

---

Hi {{firstName}},

No pitch this time — just wanted to share something that might be relevant to {{companyName}}.

{{industryInsightOrNews}}

**Why I'm sharing:**
Given {{companyName}}'s focus on {{theirFocus}}, this could impact your {{specificArea}}. We're seeing {{relatedTrend}} firsthand through our 18.6M user base in the Philippines.

If you want to discuss how this trend might create opportunities (or risks) for your SEA strategy, happy to share what we're seeing.

No pressure either way.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

### When to Use
- When you have genuinely relevant industry news
- As an alternative to "checking in" emails
- To re-engage cold prospects with value first

### Customization Tips
- The insight MUST be genuinely relevant to them
- Don't force a connection — if it's a stretch, skip this template
- Keep the insight brief (2-3 sentences max)

### Example Insights to Share
- New BSP regulation affecting crypto
- Competitor expansion into SEA
- Market data on remittance flows
- PHPC stablecoin adoption metrics

---

## 5. Breakup Email (Final Attempt)

### Template

**Subject Line Options:**
- A: `Permission to close your file?`
- B: `Unsubscribing you from my follow-ups`
- C: `One last thing before I go`

---

Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a few times about a potential partnership between {{companyName}} and coins.ph, but haven't heard back.

I'm assuming one of the following:
1. Timing isn't right
2. Partnerships aren't a priority right now
3. You're not the right person for this conversation
4. You're just not interested (totally fine)

**Before I close your file**, any quick feedback on which it is? Takes 10 seconds to reply.

If things change in the future, feel free to reach out. I'll be here.

Best of luck with {{companyName}}'s growth.

[Your Name]
coins.ph & coins.xyz

### When to Use
- After 3-4 touchpoints with no response
- As the final email in a sequence
- When you want to either get a response or move on

### Customization Tips
- This template works because it gives them an easy out
- The "10 seconds to reply" reduces friction
- Some people respond just to be nice — which opens the door

---

## Subject Line Best Practices

### What Works
- ✅ Specific numbers ($107B, 18.6M)
- ✅ Company names (theirs and yours)
- ✅ Questions (creates curiosity)
- ✅ Re: (implies ongoing conversation)
- ✅ Personalization (their name)

### What Doesn't
- ❌ ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
- ❌ Generic phrases ("Partnership opportunity")
- ❌ Misleading subject lines (damages trust)
- ❌ Too long (gets cut off on mobile)

### A/B Testing Framework

| Test | Variant A | Variant B |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Length | Short (3-5 words) | Long (descriptive) |
| Personalization | With name | Without name |
| Question vs Statement | Question | Statement |
| Numbers | With stats | Without stats |

---

## Email Sequence Timing

### Recommended Cadence

| Email | Timing | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|
| Initial | Day 1 | Open conversation |
| Follow-up #1 | Day 4-5 | Bump to top of inbox |
| Follow-up #2 | Day 9-10 | Create urgency |
| Value-Add | Day 14-16 | Provide value, re-engage |
| Breakup | Day 21-23 | Close loop or get response |

### Adjust Based On
- **Seniority:** C-level = longer intervals (they're busier)
- **Company size:** Enterprise = longer sales cycle, more patience
- **Seasonality:** Avoid major holidays, conference weeks
- **Your capacity:** Don't send more than you can follow up on

---

## Response Handling

### If They Say "Not Interested"
> "Thanks for the response, {{firstName}}. Totally understand — timing is everything. Mind if I check back in 6 months, or would you prefer I remove you from follow-ups?"

### If They Say "Not Now"
> "No problem at all. I'll set a reminder to circle back in {{timeframe}}. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if anything changes."

### If They Say "Send Info"
> "Will do. I'll send over our partnership deck and a few case studies. Any specific areas you'd like me to focus on?"

### If They Refer You to Someone Else
> "Thanks for the redirect, {{firstName}}. I'll reach out to {{newContact}}. If you think a warm intro would help, let me know — otherwise I'll reference our conversation."
