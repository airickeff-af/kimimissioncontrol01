## Touch 1: Initial Cold Outreach

### Goal
Open conversation with value-first approach. Lead with THEIR needs, not your product.

### Timing
Day 1, Tuesday-Thursday, 10-11 AM recipient timezone

### Subject Line Options (A/B Test)
```
A: {{companyName}} + Philippines' $38.4B crypto market
B: Quick question about {{companyName}}'s Asia expansion
C: Partnership opportunity: {{companyName}} + coins.ph
D: {{firstName}}, thought this might interest you
```

### Template

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I saw {{companyName}}'s recent {{recentNews}} — congrats on the momentum.

I'm reaching out from coins.ph, where I lead partnership development. We're the Philippines' largest licensed crypto exchange (18.6M users, 75-80% market share), and {{companyName}} came up as a potential fit for our expansion into {{industry}} partnerships.

{{specificValueProp}}

We've already partnered with Circle and Veem to bridge TradFi with crypto rails, and the traction has been strong.

Worth a brief 15-minute call to explore if there's synergy?

Best,
Eric Fung
Partnerships, coins.ph & coins.xyz

P.S. — If you're not the right person for this, I'd appreciate a pointer to whoever handles partnerships at {{companyName}}.

Day 4-5 after Touch 1 (if no response)

### Subject Line Options
```
A: Re: {{companyName}} + Philippines' $38.4B crypto market

C: Quick follow: {{companyName}} + coins.ph
D: Did my last email get buried?

### Template

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Wanted to make sure this didn't get buried — I know inboxes are brutal.

Quick recap: I'm exploring how {{companyName}} might benefit from partnering with coins.ph (Philippines' largest licensed exchange, 18.6M users, BSP-regulated).

{{specificValueProp}}

If the timing's not right, no worries — just say the word and I'll circle back in a few months.

If it is, I'm happy to:
• Send a one-pager first
• Jump on a 15-minute call
• Connect you directly with our {{technical/commercial}} team

What works best?

Best,
Eric

### Timing
Day 9-10 after Touch 2 (if no response)

### Subject Line Options
```
A: Thought this might interest you, {{firstName}}
B: {{recentIndustryNews}} — implications for {{companyName}}
C: Saw this and thought of our conversation
D: No pitch, just thought you'd find this relevant
```

### Template

```
Hi {{firstName}},

No pitch this time — just wanted to share something that might be relevant to {{companyName}}.

{{industryInsightOrNews}}

Why I'm sharing:
Given {{companyName}}'s focus on {{theirFocus}}, this could impact your {{specificArea}}. We're seeing {{relatedTrend}} firsthand through our 18.6M user base in the Philippines.

If you want to discuss how this trend might create opportunities (or risks) for your SEA strategy, happy to share what we're seeing.

No pressure either way.

Best,
Eric
```

### Example Insights to Share

**For Exchanges:**
> "BSP just announced new VASP licensing requirements effective Q2 2026. Existing players have a 6-month compliance window. We're already ISO 27001 certified and fully compliant — might save you 3-6 months of setup time if you're considering PH market entry."

**For DeFi:**
> "PHPC (Philippine Peso Coin) just crossed $50M in circulation. We're seeing 40% month-over-month growth in stablecoin remittances. For DeFi protocols, this represents a huge opportunity for real-world utility."

**For GameFi:**
> "Philippines just ranked #1 globally in play-to-earn adoption for the 3rd consecutive quarter. YGG alone has 50K+ active scholars. The market is maturing beyond Axie — looking for the next generation of sustainable GameFi."

## Touch 4: Follow-up #2 (Still No Response)

### Goal
Create urgency, address objections, give easy outs.

### Timing
Day 14-16 after Touch 3 (if no response)

### Subject Line Options
```
A: Last try: {{companyName}} + Philippines market access
B: Should I close the loop on this?
C: One more shot — then I'll leave you alone
D: Permission to close your file?
```

### Template

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I don't want to be that person who keeps emailing when you're not interested — so this is my last outreach unless you tell me otherwise.

Here's why I thought this was worth your time:
{{companyName}} is {{doing X}} and coins.ph has {{18.6M users in the #9 crypto adoption market globally}}. The overlap seemed obvious.

But maybe:
• Timing's off
• You're focused elsewhere
• I got the value prop wrong

If any of the above, just hit reply with "not now" and I'll disappear (gracefully).

If there's still interest, I'm here: {{calendarLink}}

Best,
Eric

P.S. — If someone else at {{companyName}} handles partnerships, happy to redirect. Just let me know.

## Touch 5: Breakup Email (Final Attempt)

### Goal
Close the loop, get definitive response, or move on.

### Timing
Day 21-23 after Touch 4 (if no response)

### Subject Line Options
```
A: Permission to close your file?
B: Unsubscribing you from my follow-ups
C: One last thing before I go
D: Should I close the loop on this?
```

### Template

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a few times about a potential partnership between {{companyName}} and coins.ph, but haven't heard back.

I'm assuming one of the following:
1. Timing isn't right
2. Partnerships aren't a priority right now
3. You're not the right person for this conversation
4. You're just not interested (totally fine)

Before I close your file, any quick feedback on which it is? Takes 10 seconds to reply.

If things change in the future, feel free to reach out. I'll be here.

Best of luck with {{companyName}}'s growth.

## Subject Line Best Practices

### ✅ What Works
- Specific numbers ($38.4B, 18.6M)
- Company names (theirs and yours)
- Questions (creates curiosity)
- "Re:" (implies ongoing conversation)
- Personalization (their name)
- Under 50 characters (mobile-friendly)

### ❌ What Doesn't
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
- Generic phrases ("Partnership opportunity")
- Misleading subject lines (damages trust)
- Too long (gets cut off on mobile)
- Spam triggers: "FREE", "URGENT", "ACT NOW"

### A/B Testing Framework

| Test Element | Variant A | Variant B |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Length | Short (3-5 words) | Long (descriptive) |
| Personalization | With name | Without name |
| Question vs Statement | Question | Statement |
| Numbers | With stats | Without stats |
| Urgency | Time-sensitive | Evergreen |

---

## Timing & Cadence

### Recommended Sequence Timeline

| Touch | Day | Goal | If Response |
|-------|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | Day 1 | Open conversation | Move to meeting booking |
| 2 | Day 4-5 | Bump to top | Move to meeting booking |
| 3 | Day 9-10 | Provide value | Move to meeting booking |
| 4 | Day 14-16 | Create urgency | Move to meeting booking |
| 5 | Day 21-23 | Close loop | Archive or re-engage later |

### Adjust Based On
- **Seniority:** C-level = longer intervals (they're busier)
- **Company size:** Enterprise = longer sales cycle
- **Seasonality:** Avoid major holidays, conference weeks
- **Your capacity:** Don't send more than you can follow up on

### Optimal Send Times

**Best Days:**
1. Wednesday (51.2% open rate)
2. Tuesday (48.5% open rate)
3. Thursday (47.8% open rate)

**Best Hours:**
1. 10:00 AM (54.1% open rate)
2. 9:00 AM (52.3% open rate)
3. 11:00 AM (51.8% open rate)

**Avoid:**
- Monday mornings (catch-up mode)
- Friday afternoons (weekend mode)
- Weekend (15-18% open rates)

Any specific areas you'd like me to focus on? Happy to customize.

I'll follow up next week to see if you have questions.

Eric
```

**Immediate Action:**
1. Acknowledge gracefully
2. Set reminder for re-engagement
3. Offer value in meantime

**Template:**
```
No problem at all, {{firstName}}. Timing is everything.

I'll set a reminder to circle back in {{timeframe}}. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if anything changes on your end.

I'll also add you to our quarterly partnership update — just the highlights, no spam.

Best,
Eric
```

### If "Not Interested" / Negative

**Immediate Action:**
1. Thank them for response

Best of luck with {{companyName}}.

Appreciate the pointer!

Eric
