## CORE CONCEPT

### 1. Character Identity
- Minecraft-based avatar with Gen Z aesthetic (tech patterns, streaming colors, fitness accessories)
- **Autonomous/semi-autonomous system** responding to real-world health/financial inputs
- Visual representation of wellness vs. financial independence tension

### 2. Dual-Metric Tracking
| Health Metrics | Wealth Metrics |
|----------------|----------------|
| Physical wellness (exercise, sleep, nutrition) | Liquid assets (32% of Gen Z allocation) |
| Mental health (stress, therapy, mindfulness) | Investments (crypto, micro-investing) |
| Preventive care (checkups, wellness spending) | Income streams (gig work, side hustles) |
| Sleep quality | Debt obligations (student loans) |

### 3. Real-Time Feedback
- **Immediate:** Status effects, animations, sound cues
- **Short-term:** Appearance modifications, equipment access
- **Long-term:** Character scaling, box environment transformation

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Spatial Framework: The Containment Box
- **7×7×5 block interior** with glass pane construction
- Transparent for monitoring, bounded for containment metaphor
- Color-coded glass: emerald (wealth), red (crisis), ice (recovery), honey (constraint)

### Base Game Mechanics
| Minecraft System | Gen Z Adaptation |
|------------------|------------------|
| Health (hearts) | Physical wellness foundation |
| Absorption effect | Preventive health investments |
| Health boost | Long-term fitness improvement |
| Regeneration | Active recovery behaviors |
| Poison | Chronic poor maintenance |
| Wither | Acute crises (burnout, emergencies) |
| XP system | Wealth proxy with compound growth |

### Implementation Pathways
1. **Education Edition** - Agent programming, MakeCode integration
