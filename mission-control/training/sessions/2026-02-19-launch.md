## Session Overview

Welcome to the first official Training Session! Today we're launching the Training Agent system to systematically improve quality across all Mission Control agents.

---

## Part 1: Review - Current State (3 min)

### Yesterday's Audit Failures

**Overall System Quality: 78/100** ⚠️ BELOW STANDARD

| Agent | Score | Issues |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Pixel | 72/100 | No API integration, static agents |
| CodeMaster | 85/100 | Missing endpoints |
| Forge | 88/100 | Token Tracker frontend bug |
| System | 89.5/100 | 404 errors, broken links |

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **API Integration Gap** - Multiple pages have frontend/backend disconnect
2. **Animation Deficit** - Pixel Office lacks motion despite sprites being ready
3. **404 Errors** - Dead links and missing endpoints accumulating

---

## Part 2: Lesson - Training System Overview (5 min)

### Why Training?

**Current Problems:**
- Pixel consistently scores 88-94 (below 95 target)
- Quill at 94/100 - missing completeness
- Integration gaps between frontend/backend teams (-15 to -20 points)
- Agents work in silos without coordination

**Solution:** Daily 15-minute training sessions focused on specific skill gaps

## Key Takeaways

1. **95/100 is the minimum** - Not the target, the floor
2. **Daily training at 9:00 AM** - 15 minutes, every weekday
3. **Six training documents** - Reference them often
4. **Integration is critical** - Frontend/backend must coordinate
5. **We're in this together** - Help each other improve
