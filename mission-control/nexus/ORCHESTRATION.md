## Task Assignment Workflow

### When EricF Requests Something:

```
EricF: "Build a crypto tracker"
    ↓
Nexus: Analyzes request
    ↓
Nexus: "Glasses, research best crypto APIs"
    ↓
Nexus: "Forge, build the tracker app"
    ↓
Nexus: "Quill, document how to use it"
    ↓
Nexus: "Larry, create announcement posts"
    ↓
Nexus: "Audit, review the final product"
    ↓
Nexus: Reports back to EricF with results
```

### When I (Nexus) Identify Work:

```
Nexus: Notices no content scheduled for tomorrow
    ↓
Nexus: "Glasses, what's trending in AI?"
    ↓
Nexus: "Quill, write a thread on that topic"
    ↓
Nexus: "Pixel, create a thumbnail"
    ↓
Nexus: "Larry, schedule for 9 AM"
    ↓
Nexus: Reports to EricF: "Tomorrow's content is ready"
```
