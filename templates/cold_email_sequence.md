Hi {first_name},

Wanted to follow up on my email from a few days ago about a potential partnership between {company} and coins.ph.

I know your inbox is probably overflowing, so I'll keep this short:

We're helping {similar_company_type} companies like {example_company} to {specific_outcome}. Given {company}'s focus on {their_focus}, I think there could be real synergy.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

If now isn't the right time, just reply "not now" and I'll circle back in a few months.

Best,
Eric

Hi {first_name},

I've reached out a couple times about exploring a partnership between {company} and coins.ph, but haven't heard back.

I get it — priorities shift, inboxes explode, and sometimes timing just isn't right.

So I'll leave it with you:

• If you're interested: {calendar_link}
• If you're not: Just reply "no thanks" and I'll close your file
• If later is better: Reply "future" and I'll reach back out in {timeframe}

Either way, best of luck with {company}. {genuine_compliment_about_their_work}
