## Subject Line Formulas

### High-Open Rate Patterns

2. **Pattern interrupt:** "This is a cold email (but...)"
3. **Social proof:** "How [Company] achieved [result]"
4. **Curiosity gap:** "The [industry] trend no one's talking about"
5. **Personalization:** "[Company Name]'s [specific observation]"

### A/B Testing Ideas

Test these variations:
- Question vs. Statement
- Short vs. Long
- Personal vs. Professional
- With emoji vs. Without
- Lowercase vs. Title Case

---

## Best Practices

### Do:
- ✅ Research the recipient before writing
- ✅ Personalize every email (at minimum: name, company, specific observation)
- ✅ Keep emails under 150 words
- ✅ Focus on their pain points, not your product
- ✅ Include a clear, single call-to-action
- ✅ Follow up 3-4 times over 2 weeks
- ✅ Track opens and replies to optimize
- ✅ Test different subject lines

### Don't:
- ❌ Use generic templates without customization
- ❌ Lead with "I" or "we" statements
- ❌ Send walls of text
- ❌ Include multiple CTAs
- ❌ Use spammy words ("FREE", "ACT NOW", excessive punctuation!!!)
- ❌ Forget to proofread
- ❌ Give up after one follow-up
- ❌ Be pushy or aggressive
