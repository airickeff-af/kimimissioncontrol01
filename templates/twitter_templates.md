# Twitter/X Cold DM Templates

## Template 1: Direct Value Proposition

**Message:**
```
Hey @{handle},

Saw your tweet about {specific_topic}. {relevant_comment}

Quick question: Are you involved in partnership decisions at {company}? Working on something at coins.ph that might align with what you're building.

Worth a brief chat?
```

## Template 2: Engagement-First Approach

**Step 1:** Engage publicly first (reply to tweet with thoughtful comment)

**Step 2 (DM after they engage back):**
```
Thanks for the reply on my comment!

Been following {company} for a bit — really impressed with {specific_thing}.

I'm building out the partner ecosystem at coins.ph/coins.xyz. Think there might be some interesting overlap with what you're doing.

Open to a quick 15-min call?
```

## Template 3: Mutual Connection Reference

**Message:**
```
Hey @{handle},

{mutual_connection} mentioned I should reach out. Said you're the person to talk to about partnerships at {company}.

Working on expanding coins.ph's partner network — specifically looking at {specific_area}.

Any interest in a brief intro call?
```

---

## Template 4: News/Trend Hook

**Message:**
```
Hey @{handle},

Noticed {company} just {recent_news}. {genuine_reaction}

We're seeing similar momentum in {related_area} at coins.ph. Wondering if there's a partnership angle worth exploring?

Quick 15-min call — yes or no?
```

---

## Template 5: Follow-up (3-4 days later)

**Message:**
```
Hey @{handle},

Following up on my DM from a few days ago about potential partnership between coins.ph and {company}.

If partnerships aren't your thing, no worries — just let me know who I should talk to instead.

If you're interested: {calendar_link}
```

## Template 6: Breakup DM

**Message:**
```
Hey @{handle},

Last nudge on this — any interest in exploring a partnership conversation? 

If not, all good. I'll stop bugging you 😄

If it's a "not right now" situation, just say "later" and I'll circle back.

Cheers!
```

## Best Practices

1. **Engage publicly first** when possible — warms up the DM
2. **Reference specific tweets** — shows you're paying attention
3. **Keep it casual** — Twitter is less formal than LinkedIn
4. **Don't be salesy** — "partnership" > "I want to sell you something"
5. **Use their language** — mirror their tone (professional vs. casual)
6. **Follow up once max** — Twitter users are less tolerant of spam

## Timing

- **Best days:** Tuesday-Thursday
- **Best times:** 10am-12pm, 2pm-4pm (prospect's timezone)
- **Avoid:** Late nights, weekends (unless they're active then)
