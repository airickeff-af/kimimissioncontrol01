## Best Practices

### The Ask
1. **Make it easy** — Provide a forwardable blurb
2. **Give an out** — "No worries if not" reduces pressure
3. **Explain why** — Context helps them decide
4. **Be specific** — Who, what, why

### The Blurb
1. **Keep it short** — 3-4 sentences max
2. **Lead with credibility** — Who you are
3. **State the reason** — Why the intro makes sense
4. **Make them look good** — Position as valuable connection

### After the Intro
1. **Thank immediately** — Within 24 hours
2. **Move to BCC** — Get connector out of thread quickly
3. **Follow up** — Update them on outcome
4. **Reciprocate** — Offer to make intros for them

### What NOT to Do
- Don't mass-blast intro requests
- Don't make them write the blurb
- Don't be pushy if they decline
- Don't forget to follow up after
