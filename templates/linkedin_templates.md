Hi {first_name},

Thanks for connecting!

Quick question: Are you the right person to discuss partnership opportunities at {company}, or should I loop in someone else?

We're currently working with {similar_company_type} to {specific_benefit}, and I think there might be a fit with what you're building.

Worth a brief 15-min call to explore?

Hi {first_name},

Following up on my note from last week about partnership opportunities between coins.ph and {company}.

Hi {first_name},

I don't want to be that person who keeps emailing into the void 😅

Last try: Any interest in exploring a partnership between coins.ph and {company}? If not, no worries — I'll stop reaching out.

If now's not the right time but might be later, just reply "future" and I'll circle back in a few months.

Either way, best of luck with {company}!

Eric

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it under 300 characters** for connection requests (LinkedIn limit)
2. **Lead with them, not you** — mention their work first
3. **One clear ask** per message
4. **Calendar link** reduces friction
5. **Reference specific details** — shows you did homework
