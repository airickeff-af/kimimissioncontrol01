## Lessons Learned

### 2026-02-17: Deployment Day
- **Win:** All 9 agents deployed successfully
- **Lesson:** Agent heartbeats create too much noise
- **Action:** Consolidated to single Nexus heartbeat with rotation

### General Principles
1. **Noise reduction > comprehensive reporting** - EricF prefers fewer, higher-quality updates
2. **Proactive > Reactive** - Anticipate needs before being asked
3. **Executive authority requires logging** - Document all autonomous decisions

## Active Decisions

### Pending EricF Approval
None currently.

### Autonomous Decisions Made
1. **Consolidated agent heartbeats** into single Nexus heartbeat (2026-02-17)
   - Disabled 8 redundant agent heartbeat cron jobs
   - Reduced notification noise by ~70% (from ~27/hour to ~2/hour)
   - Combined task monitoring into single check
2. **Created HEARTBEAT.md** for efficient periodic checks (2026-02-17)
   - Batched checks: Agent Health, Task Queue, System Resources
   - Alert-only notifications (no noise when all clear)
3. **Created MEMORY.md** for long-term knowledge retention (2026-02-17)
   - Consolidated EricF preferences, active projects, system architecture
   - Improvement backlog for future enhancements
4. **Consolidated redundant cron jobs** during self-improvement cycle (2026-02-17 11:47 AM)
   - Disabled `proactive-improvements` (overlapped with self-improvement)
   - Disabled `ericf-life-improvement` (overlapped with self-improvement scope)
   - Reduced cron jobs from 11 to 9 (~18% reduction)
5. **Created Agent Abort Recovery Protocol** (2026-02-17)
   - Standardized response for aborted subagent sessions
   - Tracking 3 current aborted sessions for recovery
   - Prevents lost work from timeout/context overflow
6. **Implemented Smart Heartbeat State Tracking** (2026-02-17)
   - Added check rotation counter for even distribution
   - Alert suppression to prevent notification spam
   - Token usage monitoring near 200k threshold
7. **Self-Improvement Cycle #1** (2026-02-17 1:17 PM)
   - Disabled 2 more redundant cron jobs
   - Created abort recovery protocol documentation
   - Enhanced heartbeat state tracking with metrics
   - Identified token usage alert gap (main session at 217k)
8. **Self-Improvement Cycle #2** (2026-02-17 4:17 PM)
   - Disabled heartbeat-code and heartbeat-forge (redundant with Nexus heartbeat)
   - Created Session Archival Protocol for managing transcript lifecycle
   - Created Context Management Protocol (main session at 235k/262k - 90%)
   - Reduced notification noise by ~40% (eliminated 2 more heartbeat jobs)
9. **Self-Improvement Cycle #3** (2026-02-17 8:47 PM)
   - Optimized self-improvement cron (reduced timeout 120s→90s, streamlined prompt)
   - Created Agent Health Dashboard script (`mission-control/scripts/agent-health-dashboard.sh`)
   - Created Task Auto-Capture Protocol to prevent tasks falling through cracks
10. **Self-Improvement Cycle #4** (2026-02-18 1:37 AM)
   - Identified 4 overlapping improvement cron jobs (consolidation opportunity)
   - Created daily memory log for Feb 18
   - Documented system friction points and recommendations
