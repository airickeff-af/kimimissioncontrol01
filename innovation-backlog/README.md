## Active Proposals

### 1. Predictive Agent Health Dashboard
**Status:** Proposed  
**Priority:** P1 - Foundation Feature  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 weeks

A Kairosoft-inspired visual dashboard that transforms Mission Control from reactive monitoring to predictive intelligence. Features real-time agent status, anomaly detection, and natural language querying.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Visual agent status board with pixel-art avatars
- Predictive anomaly detection for token usage, timeouts, failures
- Natural language queries: "Which agents are at risk?"
- Proactive recommendations and alerts

**Impact:** 60-70% reduction in agent failures, 2-3 hours/week saved

**Dependencies:** None - builds on existing infrastructure

---

### 2. Natural Language Task Router ("Mission Control Voice")
**Status:** Proposed  
**Priority:** P2 - Experience Enhancement  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 weeks

Conversational interface for delegating tasks using natural language, with intelligent routing to appropriate agents and automatic dependency management.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Intent-based task creation: "Research crypto and draft a thread"
- Smart agent selection with confidence scoring
- Context preservation across agent handoffs
- Progress tracking via natural language queries

**Impact:** 80% reduction in task setup time, enable voice delegation

**Dependencies:** Agent capability registry, stable agent operations

---

### 3. Self-Healing Automation Engine
**Status:** Proposed  
**Priority:** P2 - Reliability Enhancement  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 weeks

Autonomous layer that monitors operations, detects issues, and takes corrective action without human intervention - creating a "self-healing" system.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Automated error detection and recovery
- Context compression before limits hit
- Automatic task splitting on timeouts
- Learning from incidents to improve recovery

**Impact:** 70% reduction in manual interventions, improved uptime

**Dependencies:** Monitoring layer from Predictive Dashboard

## Research Archive

### 2026-02-18: Innovation Sprint
Comprehensive research into AI trends 2026, multi-agent orchestration, automation platforms, and dashboard innovations.

**Key Insights:**
- 1,445% surge in multi-agent system inquiries (Gartner)
- Only 23% of enterprises successfully scale AI agents (McKinsey)
- Predictive AI and self-healing systems are 2026 differentiators
- Natural language interfaces becoming standard expectation
