**Assigned:** Code-1 (Backend/Deployment Lead)  
**Due:** Feb 18, 5:00 PM  
**Completed:** Feb 18, ~9:35 PM  
**Status:** ⚠️ COMPLETED WITH ISSUES

#### Deliverables Reviewed:
- Root `index.html` created (32KB)
- `vercel.json` updated with proper API routing
- `/api/logs/activity` endpoint fixed
- `/mission-control/dashboard/API_ROUTING_FIX_SUMMARY.md` documentation

#### Scoring:
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Content Quality | 38/40 | Fixed all critical 404s, all pages now load |
| Presentation | 22/30 | Documentation clear but could be more comprehensive |
| Proactivity | 12/20 | Fixed immediate issue but didn't anticipate Tasks API data gap |
| Speed | 5/10 | **4+ hours overdue** - missed 5:00 PM deadline |
| **TOTAL** | **77/100** | **B - Acceptable** |

#### Issues Found:
- ❌ **Missed deadline by 4+ hours** (P0 critical task)
- ⚠️ Tasks API returns empty data ("no data source available")
- ⚠️ Quality gate score ~75/100, still below 95/100 target

#### Recommendations:
1. Connect Tasks API to PENDING_TASKS.md data source
2. Add pre-deploy verification to catch routing issues earlier
3. Implement automated smoke tests in deployment pipeline

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ERICF

### Immediate Actions (Tonight)
1. **Address P0 Overrun** - Discuss with Code-1 about deadline management for critical tasks
2. **Connect Tasks API** - Priority fix to reach 95/100 quality gate
3. **Review Blocked Tasks** - 27 tasks waiting for your input (API keys, approvals)

### Process Improvements
1. **Add Buffer Time** - P0 tasks should have 50% time buffer for unexpected issues
2. **Mid-Point Check-ins** - For P0 tasks, require 50% progress report before deadline
3. **Automated Testing** - Add pre-deploy smoke tests to catch 404s before deployment

### Quality Gate Action Plan
To reach 95/100 from current ~75/100:
- [ ] Fix Tasks API data source (+10 points)
- [ ] Connect Deals API to lead data (+5 points)
- [ ] Add mobile responsive verification (+5 points)
- [ ] Fix any console errors (+5 points)
- [ ] Final polish pass on all pages (+5 points)
