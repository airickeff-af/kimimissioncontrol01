## TEMPLATE 1: COLD EMAIL - EXCHANGE PARTNERSHIP

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: Access to Philippines' $107B Crypto Market

---

Hi [First Name],

I came across [Company Name]'s recent [announcement/expansion] in Southeast Asia and wanted to reach out about a strategic partnership opportunity.

I'm [Your Name] with coins.ph, the Philippines' largest licensed crypto exchange with **18.6 million registered users** and **75-80% market share** in peso-to-stablecoin liquidity.

**Why this matters for [Company Name]:**
- The Philippines ranks **#9 globally** in crypto adoption (Chainalysis 2025)
- **$38.4 billion** annual remittance market seeking crypto solutions
- Fully BSP-regulated (VASP, EMI, FX licenses) with ISO 27001 certification
- Recently launched PHPC, the first regulated Philippine Peso stablecoin

**The opportunity:**
We see strong synergies between our platforms—particularly around [liquidity sharing/cross-border settlements/user access]. Our recent partnerships with Circle and Veem have demonstrated significant traction in bridging traditional finance with crypto rails.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week to explore how we might collaborate?

I can share:
- Technical integration documentation
- Market data and user demographics
- Partnership case studies

Best regards,

## TEMPLATE 2: COLD EMAIL - GAMEFI/NFT PARTNERSHIP

**Subject:** Philippines Gaming Market + Your Platform = 🚀

---

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Is [Company Name] looking to expand in Southeast Asia?

If so, I have an interesting opportunity. The Philippines was the **#1 market for Axie Infinity** during the play-to-earn boom—40% of the player base was Filipino. That same gaming-hungry, crypto-native audience is now **18.6 million strong** on coins.ph.

**What we bring:**
- Mobile-first wallet used by millions daily
- PHPC stablecoin for seamless in-game purchases
- 600,000+ QRPH-enabled merchants for real-world utility
- Deep GameFi community connections

**Recent wins:**
We just announced a partnership with Ronin Network to connect their wallet to 600K+ Philippine merchants—bridging Web3 gaming with everyday commerce.

I'd love to explore how [Game/Platform Name] could tap into this market through integration with coins.xyz.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?
