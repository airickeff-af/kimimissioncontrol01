## 📚 KEY LEARNINGS

### What Worked:
- ✅ Parallel agent deployment accelerated delivery
- ✅ Memory Bank system improved task tracking
- ✅ Daily briefings maintained team alignment
- ✅ Proactive improvements reduced noise by 94%

### What Didn't:
- ❌ Initial heartbeat frequency was too high
- ❌ Context bloat slowed some operations
- ❌ Lead generation fell short of 30/day target

### Process Improvements:
- 🔧 Consolidated heartbeats to reduce noise
- 🔧 Implemented context compression protocol
- 🔧 Created auto-capture system for decisions

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on this week's data:

1. **Increase Lead Gen Capacity:** Consider adding a second DealFlow agent or extending research hours to hit 30/day consistently.

2. **Resolve Blockers:** 5 active blockers are limiting agent effectiveness. Prioritize PyTorch installation and API credential acquisition.

3. **Regional Focus:** With 180-300 regional leads due Feb 24, recommend starting research immediately or adjusting timeline.

4. **Quality Maintenance:** Agent quality scores are strong (65-88%). Continue current oversight approach.
