# RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

## Platform Risk

**Risk:** X algorithm changes, account suspension

**Mitigation:**
- Never build on rented land alone
- Prioritize newsletter (owned audience)
- Cross-post to LinkedIn, Threads
- Download audience data regularly

## Revenue Concentration

**Risk:** Over-reliance on one income stream

**Mitigation:**
- Target: No single stream >50% of revenue
- Diversify: Content + services + products
- Build 3+ revenue streams by Month 3

## Burnout

**Risk:** 30-day sprint leads to exhaustion

**Mitigation:**
- Schedule 1 rest day per week
- Use automation tools liberally
- Batch content creation
- Outsource editing/graphics when possible ($5-15/hr on Fiverr)

## Market Saturation

**Risk:** AI content/consulting becomes commoditized

**Mitigation:**
- Develop unique positioning (your Draper experience)
- Focus on specific niche (crypto + AI + startups)
- Build personal brand, not just topic authority
- Continuous learning and adaptation

## Technical Failures

**Risk:** Tools break, data loss

**Mitigation:**
- Regular backups (Notion export, email list download)
- Use established tools with good support
- Have backup tools identified
- Document all processes
